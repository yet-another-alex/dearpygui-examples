# dearpygui-examples

The contained code files are some basic examples of how to use [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) and create some applications with it.
The scope is very limited on purpose since this was basically me trying to learn Dear PyGui and just trying to create something interesting.
Since every now and then I still check the files to copy something, I though I might as well put them here in case somebody finds them useful.

### basic_window.py

Literally just the basic setup for a windowed application using DPG.

### draw_arrows.py

![draw_arrows.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yet-another-alex/dearpygui-examples/master/screens/drawing_arrows.png)

Example for drawing arrows when clicking on the DPG window.

### draw_squares.py

![draw_suqares](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yet-another-alex/dearpygui-examples/master/screens/drawing_squares.png)

Example for drawing randomly colored squares.

### files.py

![files.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yet-another-alex/dearpygui-examples/master/screens/files.png)

Example for using the file dialog. Choosing a directory and selecting a file in the GUI will display some information on the file.

### plot-sorting-algorithm.py

![plot-sorting-algorithm.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yet-another-alex/dearpygui-examples/master/screens/plot_sorting.png)

Example for visualizing sorting algorithms using DPG. It's not quite matplotlib but it's interesting to see. Includes all relevant parameters within the GUI.
Also includes a joke algorithm and a recursive visualization using a generator that looks nothing like it should - but it's still interesting to see.

### table.py

![table.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yet-another-alex/dearpygui-examples/master/screens/table.png)

Example for creating a table and filling it with different DPG components. Click a cell to edit it.
